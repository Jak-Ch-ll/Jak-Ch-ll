### Hello there,

I'm Jakob, a self-taught web programmer. I don't consider myself a developer yet, but I am commited to becoming one within the next few months. I quit my current job to the end of january and am commited to be doing my own projects full time from then on, while searching for a junior position as a frontend developer.


#### Current goals:

* Making some learning projects with React
* Learn and use TDD (probably with Jest)
* Building my own website (need some inspiration)


#### Tutorials I'm working on

* [Fullstack React, GraphQL and TS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8) by Ben Awad on Youtube
* [JS Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/learn/lecture/11072080#overview) by Colt Steele on Udemy


#### Techstack, I'm focussing on:

* Typescript
* React
* SCSS
* PostgreSQL
* Jest
