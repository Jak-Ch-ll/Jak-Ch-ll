### Hello there,

I'm Jakob, a self-taught web programmer. I don't consider myself a developer yet, but I am commited to becoming one within the next few months. Till the end of january I worked in the IT service sector, but I quit that job to commit myself fully to development and work on my own projects to be able to find a junior position as a frontend developer.
